# EmergencySpeechSignalDetection
The key purpose of our project is to create a system that can identify a specific keyword from an audio signal in the event of an emergency. In order to accomplish this, we have built our model by implementing an artificial neural network and have used the python programming language and its subsequent libraries to build our code.
